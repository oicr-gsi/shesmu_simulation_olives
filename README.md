# Shesmu Simulation Olives

Olive scripts modified to run in the Shesmu simulator.

Simulator does not support function imports, so functions have been copy/pasted into the main script.

Original functions are in `common.shesmu` or `production-cap/common_cap.shesmu`.

Actions are imported from `.niassawf` files in `spb-seqware-production`.

Initially for testing work in progress on [GCGI-101](https://jira.oicr.on.ca/browse/GCGI-101).
